# Hello, I'm Malek Ali 👋

I am a final-year **Computer Engineering** undergraduate at the **German University in Cairo (GUC)**, currently conducting my Bachelor Thesis research at the **University of Bonn** in Germany.

My technical focus lies at the intersection of **Data Engineering**, **Applied AI**, and **Software Quality Automation**. I love building robust data pipelines, training uncertainty-aware deep learning models, and engineering automated testing frameworks that save hundreds of hours of manual work.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 **Researching:** Currently working on "Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Precision Agriculture" using PyTorch at the University of Bonn.
- 💼 **Working:** Spearheading automation testing at **Si-Ware Systems** (saving the team 15+ hours/week).
- 🛠 **Building:** Real-time data streaming architectures using Apache Kafka, Spark, and Docker.
- 🏆 **Achieving:** DAAD Scholar (2024) and Cambridge Top in World (A-Level CS).
